# getdata-course-project

This repository contains the code and description on how I have made the course project for the Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course.

This repo contains:
- "run_analisys.R", the main code for creating the tidy data that summarizes the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone;
- "codebook.pdf", the codebook that describes in detail all variables contained in "tidydata.txt"; and
- "tidydata.txt", the output of "run_analisys.R".

The code is divided in four steps:

1. **Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set:** In this step the code reads the features description, all data from the main folder and creates a preliminary dataset.

2. **Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement and appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names:** Here the code select just the columns that represents a measure of mean or standart deviation, includes the variables for subject and activity and name all the columns.

3. **Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:** At this point the numeric representing the current activity by the subject is replaced by a string.

4. **Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject:** Finally, a independent tidy data (also included in this repo) is generated by taking the average value of each variable for each subject in each activity.
